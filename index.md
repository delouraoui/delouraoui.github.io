My full name is **Daniel Na√Øm El Ouraoui** but I'm called just Daniel. I am an MSc student at the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) at 
**University of Paris Diderot**. I'm graduated with a B.Sc degree in Computer Sciences from **University of Paris Diderot** in 2015, 
and I joined the [Matryoshka](http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/#Team) project for a Master thesis at Inria Nancy in 
the VeriDis team. The main goal of my internship is to design a higher-order Smt-solver. My supervisors are **Pascal Fontaine** and  **Jasmin Christian Blanchette**.
