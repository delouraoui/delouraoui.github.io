I am a Phd student at Inria Nancy in the VeriDis team and I'm part of the [Matryoshka](http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/#Team) project. The main goal of my Phd is to design a higher-order SMT-solver. My supervisors are **Pascal Fontaine** and  **Jasmin Christian Blanchette**. 
I'm graduated of MSc degree in Computer Sciences from ([MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php)) at **University of Paris Diderot** in 2017.

### Language and proofs for higher-order SMT (work in progress)
Haniel Barbosa, Jasmin Christian Blanchette, Simon Cruanes, Daniel El Ouraoui, and Pascal Fontaine. Accepted at 5th Workshop on Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP 2017). [Preprint (PDF)](http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/pubs/PxTP2017.pdf) 

### Proof in Coq of the IE property for the Linear Substitution (Ls)
	
  Available [here](https://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mayero/IE/)  
  This is a formalization of the proof of Beniamino Accattoli of the preservation of the strong normalization of 
  linear substitution realized in L3 and M1 internships, at the LIPN.
  My advisors were **Micaela Mayero** and **Damiano Mazza**. 
  For more details you may look in the unpublished article about this formalization 
  [here](/links/IEproperty.pdf)
